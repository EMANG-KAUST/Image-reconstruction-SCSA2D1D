# Image reconstruction SCSA2D1D
SCSA2D1D is Semi-Classical Signal Analysis (SCSA) based image reconstruct method that uses dimension seperation of schrodinger operator [1]. It is easy to use :

1- import .mat files containing the image,
2- choose the SCSA paramters : h, gm, fe
3- Afther runing the SCSA2D1D, the reconstructed image using these parameters will be displayed.
